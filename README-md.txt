## Analysis Steps

For this solution, we are to make an array list using a generic class arraylist.

### Design

I first used the Generic class ArrayList to create an array. 
I next created a for loop to fill the array list with numbers up to 10.
I then created a method to shuffle the array.

### Testing

after creating the array list and the for loop to fill it,
I printed out the list to see if it filled up the list with numbers.
worked.

I then created a method to shuffle the array list.
inside the method I created a for loop set to the array list size. 
inside this for loop I created a temp place holder for the numbers in the array list.
then set the number in the array list. 
this repeated until the array was filled.
I then ran the method to make sure the array was shuffled.
